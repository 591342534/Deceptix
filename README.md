# Decepticon Communication Software ![Decepticon Icon](./Images/Decepticon_Icon.jpg "Decepticon Icon")

**Description**: A TCP/IP application written in C++ designed to interface with and remotely control a robot designed by [Dr. Elliot Coleshill](https://github.com/ecoleshill). Commands included the ability to drive in all directions, raise or lower the front-facing arm and open or close the mounted claw. Real-time communication both to and from the robot was possible by implementing multiple threads which opened a bidirectional channel for robot commands and telemetry data.
